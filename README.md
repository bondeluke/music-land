# a world of music
playing with musical ideas in code

## concepts
- patterns. what is a pattern? (at least 2 elements required)
  - patterns in space (art, written language)
  - patterns in time (music, spoken language)
  - space + time = spacetime. space and time flow into each other
- rhythm (patterns in time felt as beats/minute) 
- pitch  (patterns in time felt as cycles/second)
- relationships in time (and why perfection does not exist)
  - 1:1 (unison)
  - 2:1 (octave)
  - 3:2 (perfect 5th)
  - 4:3 (perfect 4th)
  - 5:4 (major 3rd)
  - 8:5 (minor 6th)
  - 5:3 (major 6th)
  - 6:5 (minor 3rd)
  - 9:8 (major 2nd)
  - 16:9 (dominant 7th)
- landscapes (tuning systems) - making space to play
  - rhythmic landscapes (e.g. kick + snare)
  - pitch landscapes (e.g. 12-tone equal temperament)  
- melody (exploring/dancing in a landscape using rhythm and pitch)
    - scales (major scale, dorian)
    - modes (dorian is a mode of ionian)
    - scale quality (light, dark, etc.)  
    - scale groups (e.g. 7 modes of major scale)
    - group symmetry  
    - fingerings
    - left-hand / right-hand
      - pitch symmetry (same pitches, different fingers)
      - hand symmetry (same fingers, different pitches)
      - offset 
- harmony
  - chords
  - inversions
  - negation  
  - chord progressions
